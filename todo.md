<!-- - Klax tiles move down the conveyor belt in the lane that it's in. -->
<!-- - Once they reach the bottom, if the stacker is in the same lane, they are put on the stacker -->
<!-- - The stacker can move left and right along the lanes. -->
<!-- - The stacker can drop the last caught tile onto the bin lane it is currently over. -->
- The stacker can throw the top most tile up onto the conveyor belt.
- If the bins ever have three or more klax tiles in a line (vertial, horizontal, diagonal), a Klax then those tiles disapear and points are added to the score board.
- If a klax reaches the bottom of the conveyor belt and the stacker isn't there, it is dropped from play.
- There are a limited number of tiles that can be dropped per round if the limit is reached, the game is over.
- You get points for getting a Klax:
    - 50 	    3-fold vertical
    - 1.000 	3-fold horizontal

    - 5.000 	3-fold diagonal
    - 10.000 	4-fold diagonal
    - 20.000 	5-fold diagonal 
- A combination of two standard klaxes doubles the score.
